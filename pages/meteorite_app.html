<div style="margin: 1%">
    <p>
        An R-based web app to visualize meteorite crashes.<br>
        This Web app imports data from the NASA data portal then prepares a set of well-documented meteor crashes. 
        A slider allows you to choose a starting year and an end year for a timeframe. The crashes will be filtered to fit into the chosen timeframe and are displayed on a world map. <br>
        Additional parts of the dashboard are a box to count the number of crashes in the selected timeframe and a histogram plot to visualize the weight distribution of the meteorites. <br>

    </p>
    <p>
        If you play with the selection of the start and end of the timeframe you will notice that in earlier years only comparably heavy meteorites were observed. 
        Also, most observations take place from 1900 and generally seem to occur in comparably more industrialized areas at each point in time. <br>
        This app will be extended to feature a customizable ui and a simulation based on a rocket launch and rocket engine dataset.
        
    </p>
    <h2>Development goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fully customizable ui</li>
        <li>HTML design to create a modern appearance</li>
        <li>Rocket launch explorer map</li>
        <li>Simulation of rocket ascent</li>
    </ul>

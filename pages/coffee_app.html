<div style="margin: 1%">
    <p>
        An R-based webapp to show a dashboard for a coffee franchise based on IBM's coffeeshop dataset.<br>
        The dataset is accessible under the Cognos Analytics page <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/12/beanie-coffee-1113">here</a>. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>
        How this App works
    </h2>
    <p>
        First, the data on April sales of a simulated coffee chain is retrieved from the Cognos Analytics page. 
        This data consists of multiple tables in the form of an SQL database but is limited to information on 3 of the 8 mentioned coffeeshops. 
        As an initial step, tables are joined to make information easily accessible for the tiles in the dashboard. 
        Simple sums and aggregates are constructed for the chain level to give a broad overview while information on the store-level currently contains a data-envelopment-analysis to determine efficiency. 
        An explanation of the method will be added soon to be accessed by clicking. 
        The last part of this project will feature analyses and information on how a change in strategy over time can affect sales and consumer interactions.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
        Development is still in progress so the app will be regularly updated.
    </p>
    <h2>Development goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A customizable overview of chain level aggregates</li>
        <li>An analysis of the effect of various variables on sales and quantity</li>
        <li>More options to customize the dynamic report on outlet level</li>
        <li>An option to reroll the simulated input levels</li>
        <li>Tooltips to explain the aim of a specific plot</li>
        <li>Functionally abstracted code</li>
        <li>Improved HTML for presentation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This app will utilize a consumer dataset as in the coffee app and categorize consumers according to their buying behavior. <br>
        A use of categorized and classified customers will be planning of inventory to cater specifically to the needs of the groups of customers frequenting a certain store location or to plan marketing interventions towards strategies that are proven effective in a certain type of the target audience. <br>
        To achieve this, I will employ a mix of unsupervised classification methods (based on K) and a time series based analysis of reaction to a marketing relevant decision variable. <br>
        A working version of this app will be published soon.

    </p>
